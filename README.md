# A boilerplate for static websites
This is the custom boilerplate we use for our static websites. It uses Middleman as a site generator and Webpack as static asset processor and bundler.

## Requirements
- Ruby (this project assumes you use [rbenv](http://rbenv.org))
- Node.js

## Usage
1. Copy the files to the dir you want to start a new project in.
2. Run `script/bootstrap` to install all Ruby and Node.js dependencies.
3. Run `script/server` to start a development server
4. Run `script/build` to build an optimized version of the site

## More info
This is just a quick setup of [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) and [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io). Checkout the documentation for those projects for more info on how to create a sick website with this.


## To do
- Configure webpack to do optimized builds
